The recent collapse of BluSmart, an Indian electric vehicle (EV) ride-hailing startup once celebrated for its eco-friendly services, has exposed a sophisticated financial fraud orchestrated by its founders. Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who simultaneously managed Gensol Engineering Limited, allegedly misused ₹262 crore ($31 million) of government loans intended for EV procurement, diverting funds through opaque transactions and fabricated contracts. This report dissects the scam’s mechanics, regulatory failures, and societal impact, while proposing IT-driven solutions to prevent similar frauds. By integrating advanced fraud detection systems, robust corporate governance tools, and AI-powered oversight mechanisms, organizations can mitigate risks associated with application fraud, fund misappropriation, and synthetic identity schemes.

# The BluSmart-Gensol Fraud: Anatomy of a Collapse

## Background and Corporate Structure
BluSmart, founded in 2019, operated a fleet of 6,400 EVs across Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, distinguishing itself through well-maintained vehicles and competitive pricing. However, its business model relied on a complex financial arrangement with Gensol Engineering, a solar energy firm also co-founded by the Jaggi brothers. Gensol secured ₹830 crore ($97 million) in loans from government-backed institutions under the pretext of purchasing EVs for BluSmart’s operations. While ₹568 crore ($67 million) was allocated to EV acquisitions, the remaining ₹262 crore ($31 million) vanished without trace, raising red flags during a routine audit by the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

# The Fraudulent Scheme
## Misuse of Public Funds
The Jaggi brothers exploited intercompany transactions to mask fund diversion. Gensol leased EVs to BluSmart at inflated rates, creating a circular flow of capital that obscured the misuse of loans. SEBI’s interim order revealed that only 68% of the loan amount was spent on EVs, while the rest financed unrelated ventures or personal expenses. This misallocation violated India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the Companies Act, which mandate transparent use of public funds.

## Fabricated Contracts and Investor Deception
In early 2025, Gensol announced 30,000 EV pre-orders during the Bharat Mobility Expo, claiming partnerships with nine firms. However, subsequent investigations exposed these memoranda of understanding (MOUs) as fraudulent. The MOUs lacked critical details such as pricing, delivery schedules, or binding commitments, and the purported clients denied involvement. This tactic, akin to synthetic identity fraud in financial applications, involved creating fictitious entities to inflate perceived demand and attract additional investments.

## Regulatory and Governance Failures
SEBI identified a "complete breakdown" in Gensol’s corporate governance, with the Jaggi brothers bypassing board oversight to approve fraudulent transactions. The absence of segregated duties allowed them to control both fund disbursement and accounting, eliminating checks against misuse. Auditors failed to verify the physical existence of EVs, relying instead on forged documentation—a lapse highlighting the need for IoT-enabled asset tracking systems.

# Impact and Fallout
BluSmart’s abrupt shutdown stranded thousands of commuters and drivers, while investors faced losses exceeding ₹500 crore ($59 million). The scandal eroded trust in India’s startup ecosystem, prompting SEBI to bar the founders from capital markets and dissolve Gensol’s board. This case underscores systemic vulnerabilities in startup financing, particularly the lack of safeguards against related-party transactions and identity fraud.
